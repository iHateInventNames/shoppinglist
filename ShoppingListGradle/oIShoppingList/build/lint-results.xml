        summary="Finds calls to locale-ambiguous `String` manipulation methods"
        explanation="Calling `String#toLowerCase()` or `#toUpperCase()` *without specifying an explicit locale* is a common source of bugs. The reason for that is that those methods will use the current locale on the user&apos;s device, and even though the code appears to work correctly when you are developing the app, it will fail in some locales. For example, in the Turkish locale, the uppercase replacement for `i` is *not* `I`.

If you want the methods to just perform ASCII replacement, for example to convert an enum name, call `String#toUpperCase(Locale.US)` instead. If you really want to use the current locale, call `String#toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault())` instead."

        explanation="This check scans through all the Android API calls in the application and warns about any calls that are not available on *all* versions targeted by this application (according to its minimum SDK attribute in the manifest).

If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
If your code is *deliberately* accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level.

If you are deliberately setting `android:` attributes in style definitions, make sure you place this in a `values-v11` folder in order to avoid running into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.

Similarly, you can use tools:targetApi=&quot;11&quot; in an XML file to indicate that the element will only be inflated in an adequate context."

        explanation="If a string contains a &apos;%&apos; character, then the string may be a formatting string which will be passed to `String.format` from Java code to replace each &apos;%&apos; occurrence with specific values.

This lint warning checks for two related problems:
(1) Formatting strings that are invalid, meaning that `String.format` will throw exceptions at runtime when attempting to use the format string.
(2) Strings containing &apos;%&apos; that are not formatting strings getting passed to a `String.format` call. In this case the &apos;%&apos; will need to be escaped as &apos;%%&apos;.

NOTE: Not all Strings which look like formatting strings are intended for use by `String.format`; for example, they may contain date formats intended for `android.text.format.Time#format()`. Lint cannot always figure out that a String is a date format, so you may get false warnings in those scenarios. See the suppress help topic for information on how to suppress errors in that case."

        message="Format string &apos;widget_no_items&apos; is not a valid format string so it should not be passed to String.format"

        summary="Checks that format strings are valid"
        explanation="If a string contains a &apos;%&apos; character, then the string may be a formatting string which will be passed to `String.format` from Java code to replace each &apos;%&apos; occurrence with specific values.

This lint warning checks for two related problems:
(1) Formatting strings that are invalid, meaning that `String.format` will throw exceptions at runtime when attempting to use the format string.
(2) Strings containing &apos;%&apos; that are not formatting strings getting passed to a `String.format` call. In this case the &apos;%&apos; will need to be escaped as &apos;%%&apos;.

NOTE: Not all Strings which look like formatting strings are intended for use by `String.format`; for example, they may contain date formats intended for `android.text.format.Time#format()`. Lint cannot always figure out that a String is a date format, so you may get false warnings in those scenarios. See the suppress help topic for information on how to suppress errors in that case."

By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.

This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.

Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.

* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or portrait)you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when making changes)

* The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding new translations for existing string resources.

In Eclipse there is a quickfix to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a resource lookup."
